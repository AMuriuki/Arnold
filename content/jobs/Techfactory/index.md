#### Achievements

- Built an authentication using Python's Flask micro-framework with a Postgres Relational Database.
- Built a micro-service that would fetch articles from two APIs [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/download/) and [Medline](https://medlineplus.gov/about/developers/webservices/) medical databases.
- The service would then extract data from the articles and store in Mongo (a non-relational) Database.
